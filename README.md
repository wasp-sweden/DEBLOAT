Here we collect resources, tools, case studies for the DEBLOAT expedition project supported by [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/)

Debloating tools
---

As part of the WASP DEBLOAT Expedition, we develop the following tools to remove unnecessary code at different levels of the software stack
- [Depclean](https://github.com/castor-software/depclean) to remove unnecessary third-party dependencies in Java projects
- [Jdbl](https://github.com/castor-software/jdbl/) to remove unnecessary methods and classes, based on dynamic traces
